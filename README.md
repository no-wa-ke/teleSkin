*real time cam function added

Includes example VDMX project file for bringing in sources from VDMX - can give syphon inputs for layer to find live faces on, and what to mask those faces with.

You can also switch modes and have it automatically crossfade between images stored in the "faces" directory. You will need to position the faces relative to the included 'faceTemplate.psd' - the texture coordinates are based off the face in that image, so it will give you a rough idea of where to position things so they match up to the "stored" face coordinates.
